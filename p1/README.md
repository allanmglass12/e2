## Game Planning
+ • Player A and Player B each throw a "model pig" ... each of which has a dot on one side.
+ • The player receives points based on the way the pig lands:
+   ~ Sider: The pig is lying on its side [0 Points]
+   ~ Razorback: The pig is lying on its back [5 Points]
+   ~ Trotter: The pig is standing upright [10 Points]
+   ~ Snouter: The pig is leaning on its snout [15 Points]
+   ~ Leaning Jowler: The pig is leaning on its snout and ear [20 Points]
+ • The winner is the player with the highest score.
